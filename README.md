### A Visual Analytics System for Incident Management Process Assessment and Compliance

Incident Management (IM) is the process to prevent, protect and react to incidents affecting an organization.
Most of the existing works address the problem of the incidents considering technical aspects as network and access vulnerabilities to patch.
Instead, very few works consider the importance of IM from the process point of view, that is the way in which an organization actually implement security procedures.
Inside an organization, IM should be a well defined process in order to be prepared in case of (re)occurrences of the incidents and their alerts.
Different security frameworks exist describing guidelines and best practices to properly define such a process.
Therefore, the organizations should be compliant with such frameworks to be prepared in case of incidents.
Assessing whether an organization is compliant or not with security standards requires a big effort as the main methodologies to do so are based on manual analysis and evaluation of evidences (as interviews and log analysis).
To facilitate this task, we design a IMPAVID (Incident Management Process Assessment through Visual Interactive Data analysis), a visual analytics solution to support the assessor in the IM process assessment.
It is based on the definition of a cost model to quantify the impacts of the causes of non-compliance based on the application domain configurable by the security assessor.
In particular, the proposed system assists the security assessor in:
(i) assessing the compliance between a reference IM process model as defined in security standards and the IM process as actually performed by an organization;
(ii) setting the parameters of a cost model to suitably represent the domain of interest.
The aim is to support the assessor during the compliance analysis to increase its level of awareness and helping her/him in taking informed decisions.
We validate the proposed approach through a set of usage scenarios based on a publicly available dataset containing data from a real incident management log of an IT company. 
They show how an assessor uses the proposed solutions to detect the main deviations in the Incident Management process and how it makes the assessor more aware of the security issues regarding IM process.
